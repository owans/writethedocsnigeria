![About WriteTheDocs](/assets/writethedocs.JPG)

Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation.

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.
